# QR Code Attendance Checker

This is a QR code attendance checker. Students can sign up and scan the QR code that admin accounts create for them. As soon as they scan it, their attendance is recorded for the respective teacher with the scanned QR code.

## Features

- **Dynamic QR Codes**: The QR code is dynamic and changes every 5 seconds to mitigate cheat check-ins.
- **Selective Attendance**: Teachers can select specific students to avoid recording any other external student from scanning their QR codes.
- **Manage Students**: Teachers can remove recorded students and edit the students' names.
- **Student Signup**: Students are required to provide their section number and order number in the students list (of that section) during signup.

## Limitations

- Both teachers and students require an internet connection for the scans.
- Making a teacher account might require payment in the future.
